## Website Summary

*Problem:* StudyFlow addresses the productivity and mental health difficulties of studying at home; it's a Pomodoro Timer with multiple features â†’ An integrated flashcard app, extra fun buttons, and the ability to poke your friends!

*Inspiration:* The idea came from one of our own needs; we wanted a tool that enables you to practice flashcards more consistently, while also encouraging you to study. By merging the timer and flashcards into a single website, it reduces the friction the typical student faces when deciding to study or to relax.

*But wait, there's more!*

*Further Functions:* Humans are social creatures - it's unsurprising that so many of us have felt demotivated during COVID-19 and working from home. And so, our website has a range of extra functions to keep things entertaining! A meme button (which generates and displays a funny meme or a cute dog), an exercise button (which suggests a random short exercise to keep your physical body engaged), and finally, our poke button. Although we weren't able to implement this in our current website as the API for Facebook poking requires whitelisting, the idea is that you can poke your friends during your breaks so that you can show off that you've finished a study session!

And of course, in both the spirit of Easter and internet culture, we've added a few little easter eggs to the website ðŸ™‚

## How we Built It

Our team is composed of four 2nd year students who have a computer science background; except only in the languages of Python, C and R. None of us had any experience developing a website, so we had to be efficient, hopeful, and realistic.

*Backend:*  Everything was handled by Firebase; it provided us with hosting servers, the domain name, as well as Facebook/Google login authentication. We used Git as our version control.

*Frontend:* We mainly used react.js with material UI to develop the website. Figma was used for high-fidelity wireframing of advanced features for the future.

## Greatest Challenges & Proudest Moments

Our team all worked on varying aspects of the process - and so our greatest challenges and proudest moments all varied;

Jenn's greatest challenge was learning four languages on the go (HTML, JS, CSS, ReactJS), while also trying to implement meme buttons and exercise routines. She's most proud of how well we worked together as a team!
